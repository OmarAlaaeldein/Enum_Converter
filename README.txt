the following file converts all .cpp,.c,.h,.hpp files enum data types to .py
I implemeted the code with OOP design with open/clossprinciple and Factory design to avoid if/elif complex conditionals
the code has few error and is not perfect in design but I could have implemeted it better if I learn regex library 
Included are some screenshots of the Script/Code
the code will create a file called enums in the file's current directory where all files with enums data types will be converted
AP_ENUM.py is my approach without using OOP which is worse and does not quite deliver a good results
cse313_hw2_120180022.py contain my optimal solution 
enums is the created folder from the script
